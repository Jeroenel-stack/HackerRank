Key to success:

Use Reverse array to check if string is a palindrom
Do NOT use  max number of  for…loops I can use here is 1
When element  from   START does NOT match element from the BACK then, create 2 strings…  in 1 string remove the element from the start + pass it into the function to check if it is a palindrom, if yes return Index from Start…   if not… then   remove the element from the BACK, pass the string without element in the BACK into the palindrom checker, if it becomes a palindrom, then return BACK INDEX
KEY: There can only be 1 letter that converts the string into a palindrom
Mini rule: if ALL elements str being passed into the palindromChecker function are same, then it is TRUE
Mini rule2: if ALL elements of the str are identical from the start, then return -1
