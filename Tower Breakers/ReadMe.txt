Solution Explanation:

If the number of towers are even that means player 2 is the winner. No matter what move player 1 tries, player 2 will have a move to counter.
If the height of each tower is 1 that means player 1 cannot move at all so again player 2 is winner.
And for all other cases, player 1 is the winner.
