Flow Explanation:

Separate contests into important and not important.

Sum all luck from not important contests.

For important contests:

You can lose at most k contests to gain luck.

If more than k, you must win the lowest-luck contests and subtract their luck.

Add the luck from contests you lose.

Return the total count of luck.
