In this post, We are going to solve HackerRank Angry Professor Problem. A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, the professor decides to cancel a class if fewer than some number of students are present when class starts. Arrival times go from on time (arrival time â‰¤ 0) to arriving late (arrival Time > 0).

Given the arrival time of each student and a threshold number of attendees, determine if the class is canceled.

Example

n = 5

k = 3

a = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

The first 3 students arrived. The last 2 were late. The threshold is 3 students, so the class will go on. Return YES.

Note: Non-positive arrival times (a[i] < 0) indicate the student arrived early or on time; positive arrival times (a[i] > 0) indicate the student arrived a[i] minutes late.
