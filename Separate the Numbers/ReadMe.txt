Steps

Edge case check

If s.length < 2, immediately return "NO" (cannot form a sequence).

Try all possible starting numbers

For each possible length i (from 1 to floor(s.length/2)):

Let first = s.slice(0, i) → first number of the sequence.

Use BigInt to handle very large numbers.

Build the sequence string

Initialize finalStr = "".

Repeatedly append consecutive numbers:

first, first+1, first+2, …

Stop when finalStr.length ≥ s.length.

Compare with input

If finalStr === s:

Return "YES first".

If no match found

Return "NO".
