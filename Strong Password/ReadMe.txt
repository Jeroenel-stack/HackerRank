We need to check if a password is strong. A password is strong if it has at least:

One digit (0–9)

One lowercase letter (a–z)

One uppercase letter (A–Z)

One special character (!@#$%^&*()-+)

Minimum length of 6

We must return the minimum number of characters that need to be added to make the password strong.
